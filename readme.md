# Sneaky Cam

A photo taking webapp, disguised as a website with some articles.

The _social buttons_ below the images act like controls for your camera to take some pictures without anybody noticing:

| Button | Function |
|-|-|
| P | _P_ is for _picture_, this button will snap a picture. |
| F | _F_ is for _flip_, this flips the camera if the device supports it. Jep... that's selfie support built in! |
| T | _T_ is for _Tw_... _T_ is for _Toggle_. This will toggle the camera view, which will show up on top of the pictures, with some transparency, so it's not too obvious. |

Clicking _Overview_ in the top menu will show all the pictures that were taken (as of now this will reset on a refresh). _Articles_ will get you back to the main page.
